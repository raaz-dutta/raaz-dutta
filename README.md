🎯 Objective
Analyze birth rate trends across different countries.

Explore relationships between birth rate and factors like GDP, fertility rate, literacy, and urbanization.

Apply clustering to group countries with similar demographic profiles.

📦 Dependencies
Install the following Python libraries before running the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
📊 Dataset
The sample dataset includes the following features for multiple countries:

Country

Year

BirthRate (per 1,000 people)

GDP (per capita)

FertilityRate

FemaleLiteracyRate

UrbanPopulation%

You can replace the sample dataset with actual data from sources like the World Bank or Kaggle.

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository or download the script.

Ensure all dependencies are installed.

Run the Python script:

bash

Edit
python birth_rate_analysis.py
📈 Key Features
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Histograms

Correlation matrix

Scatter plots

Clustering:

KMeans used to identify country clusters based on demographic factors.

Insights:

Rich vs. poor country birth rate trends

Role of education, fertility, and urbanization

🧠 Conclusion
Countries with higher GDP and education levels typically show lower birth rates.

Fertility rate has the strongest positive correlation with birth rate.

Clustering enables strategic targeting of health and education policies.

📌 Future Enhancements
Time series analysis for multi-year trends.

Geospatial visualization with choropleth maps.

Integration with real-time World Bank APIs.
